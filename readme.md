# CMS

## Requirements
- uses gulp.js for sass compilation, image optimization, and js
  concatenation/uglifying [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)
- Node is required to get Gulp up and running.

## Installation
1. If you have node.js installed already, skip to step 2. Otherwise, I recommend you install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Once homebrew is installed, run
   > brew install node

2. npm install -g gulp to install gulp globally. Note: if it complains about
   permissions, run it with sudo.

3. In the project root type npm install. This should install all the necessary
components.

4. run composer install to get all the php side set up

5. run "gulp" to start watching!


## Roadmap
- All emails for resets, etc need to use [Ink](http://zurb.com/ink)
