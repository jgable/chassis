- Node is required to get Gulp up and running.

## Installation
1. If you have node.js installed already, skip to step 2. Otherwise, I recommend you install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Once homebrew is installed, run
   > brew install node

2. In the project root type npm install. This should install all the necessary
components.

3. run composer install to get all the php side set up

4.
